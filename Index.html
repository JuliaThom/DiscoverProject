        <h1>Be welcome!</h1>
        <p>My name is Julia, I am a software developer and either I would like to introduce myself to you, or you have found your way here out of curiosity.</p>
        <p>In both cases, I am very pleased to welcome you, and perhaps we both will benefit from this digital encounter. </p>
        <p>On the following pages, you will get to know me and my abilities and skills.</p>
        <p>However, it also requires a little effort on your part so that we both have invested something in getting to know each other in the end.</p>
        <p>If you are ready or curious enough, press the button and discover my world.</p>
